# week-two-project

1. What requirements did you achieve?
All my images have alt text attributes for accessibility.
I have implemented media queries for a responsive design (iphone SE and desktop)
I have correctly used event handlers to switch images based on what is clicked on, whether the user has reached the end of the array and what button has been pressed.

For stretch goals I have also implemented a media query for tablet screen size. I have also used tab-index and aria-labels on my buttons to improve interaction for those with accessibility needs.

2. Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
I would have liked to have implemented a piece of code to update the index when an image was clicked on so that my left and right buttons still functioned after the user clicked a specific image.

3. If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
I feel that if I had extra time in my weekend I could have fixed this bug. I had the code for it almost written but could not figure out where to place it.

4. What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?
The main bug I struggled to overcome was programming my left and right buttons to skip to the other end of my array when they were at the first and last images. To fix this I added if statements to my changeImage function which respectively changed the image to the 0 index or to the index.length.

5. What went really well and what could have gone better?
Creating styling for different media queries went very well, creating my array in JS also helped me to find an easier way to do something than my initial plan. 

I struggled a lot with the bug for my next and previous buttons but did manage to problem solve it.
