# week-two-project

1. What requirements did you achieve?
All my images have alt text attributes for accessibility.
I have implemented media queries for a responsive design (iphone and desktop)
I have correctly used event handlers to switch images based on what is clicked on, whether the user has reached the end of the array and what button has been pressed.

For stretch goals I have also implemented a media query for tablet screen size. I have also used tab-index and aria-labels on my buttons to improve interaction for those with accessibility needs.

2. Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?


3. If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?


4. What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?


5. What went really well and what could have gone better?
